## Introduction

Langchain Summarizer is a simple web application that leverages the power of Langchain and OpenAI's GPT to automatically generate summaries of web page content based on the provided URL. This project aims to provide users with a convenient and efficient way to extract key information and main points from lengthy articles, blog posts, news, and other web pages.

## Features

- **URL Summarization**: Users can input any valid URL, and the application will process the content to generate a concise and coherent summary.
- **Customizable Summary Length**: The app allows users to specify the desired length of the summary, allowing for tailored outputs.
- **Real-time Summarization**: The summarization process happens in real-time, providing quick results to users without long waiting times.
- **Responsive and User-Friendly Interface**: The application's intuitive design ensures easy navigation and a seamless user experience across various devices.

## How It Works

Langchain Summarizer utilizes advanced natural language processing techniques and the power of GPT to generate high-quality summaries. When a user enters a URL, the application fetches the content from the web page and processes it through GPT, which then produces a summary based on the provided input.

The summarization process involves the following steps:

1. **URL Input**: The user enters the URL of the web page they want to summarize.
2. **Web Page Content Retrieval**: The application retrieves the content from the specified URL.
3. **Text Preprocessing**: The content is preprocessed to remove any noise and irrelevant information.
4. **Summarization**: GPT takes the preprocessed content as input and generates a summary of the specified length.
5. **Display Summary**: The generated summary is presented to the user on the web interface.

## Setup and Installation
